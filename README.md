# LunchBot

LunchBot is a simple SlackBot, for scraping Facebook pages of local restaurants for daily/lunch offers. The current state of the bot is very naive, making assumptions about what constitutes a Facebook post with lunch offer etc.

## Installation

The bot itself is a simple node.js application, in order to run it, you need to configure a new bot on [Slack](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) - you need to store the API key for the application. In addition, you should set up a new app on Facebook, noting down the App ID and Secret, both of which the bot also needs to operate.

## Running

You can simply run the bot with the following line. This will both set the necessary environmental variables as well as start the app.

```bash
BOT_SLACK_API_KEY={your_slack_api_key_here} BOT_FB_APP_ID={your_fb_app_id_here} BOT_FB_APP_SECRET={your_fb_app_secret_here} node index.js
```

Alternatively, you can set up a free [Heroku](http://heroku.com) app, defining the variables there and letting the specified Procfile do the rest.

## Using

Once LunchBot has been added to a channel, just ask her about lunch and she'll reply back with a bunch of offers that she managed to scrape. Current keywords that will trigger the search are "offer", "lunch" and "menu". Keywords are only looked for in messages mentioning lunchbot.

## Architecture

The app consists of two main components: the bot and the sources of information. Currently, the app simply creates the bot and defines a few sources for restaurants in Tallinn. The code should be sufficiently simple to understand and modify, most importantly, `FacebookSource`, the representation of a FB page of interest should be looked at, as well how the predefined locations are handled in `index.js`.
